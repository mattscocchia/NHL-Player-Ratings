# NHL-Player-Ratings
## Introducing the [ScotiaStat](https://linktr.ee/scotiastat) Player Rating system.
These ratings are intended to be a catch-all metric to value a player's performance both defensively, and offensively. They are far from perfect, but they are an attempt at taking (free) publicly sourced data and utilizing it to build a player performance evaluation metric. They are based on the "all-in-one player value stat" (Net Rating) that Dom Luszczyszyn at The Athletic has made. I have tried to design this to be easy to reproduce and/or alter.

The player and team statistics are from [MoneyPuck](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm) and the Woodmoney data is from [PuckIq](https://puckiq.com/woodmoney)

I will be adding more in depth comments when I have the time to. I will also add new code when I have new changes or additions. Unless my commitments change, I will be tirelessly working on this behind the scenes. If you have any comments/suggestions/feedback or want to be a part of this somehow, please let me know. I am open to hearing how you think this can be improved. You can message me on any method you prefer [X](https://x.com/ScotiaStat), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scotiastathockey), [Email](matthewscocchia@gmail.com).

If I have time in the future, I will try to add code for more open source hockey related advanced statistics/ratings/models, but for now this is all I have to share. Also, please feel free to copy this and make it your own. It is meant to be used as a starting point.

Enjoy
